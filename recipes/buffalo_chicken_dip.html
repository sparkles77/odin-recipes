    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halfs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup ranch dressing</li>
        <li>1 cup hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese</li>
        <li>3 stalks green onion, green parts only, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Place chicken onto a large sheet of foil and sprinkle evenly 
            with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Wrap foil around chicken 
            to form a pouch, sealing it around the edges. Place foil pouch 
            onto a rimmed baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and 
            let stand for 15 minutes to cool slightly. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees 
            F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish with cooking spray. </li>
        <li>Stir together cream cheese, ranch dressing, and hot sauce in a large 
            bowl until well combined. </li>
        <li>Roughly chop or shred cooked chicken. Add to cream cheese mixture along 
            with Cheddar cheese; stir to combine. Pour mixture into the prepared 
            baking dish and sprinkle with blue cheese. </li>
        <li>Bake, uncovered, until bubbly and golden around the edges, about 30 minutes. 
            Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with green onions and serve. </li>
    </ol>
